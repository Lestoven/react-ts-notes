# üóíÔ∏è React Notes App

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an **unfinished project** inspired by **Google Keep**.  
> I started this as a way to practice **React with TypeScript** and experiment with UI/UX patterns similar to Keep.  
> The app is **unfinished**, and many features are still missing or only partially implemented.

Currently, all data is **mocked** and stored in **localStorage** for development and testing purposes.
